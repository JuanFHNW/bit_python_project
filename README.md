## 🧐 Analysis & Context

### The Problem
Users often struggle to manage daily tasks—such as homework, assignments, and personal to-do's—because existing tools are polarized: they are either too complex with overwhelming features or too simple, lacking data persistence.

### Our Solution
**Task Tracker** offers a minimalist, reliable middle ground. It launches immediately into a dashboard of your most urgent tasks and ensures data integrity by validating all inputs. All changes are saved automatically to a local JSON file (`task_data.json`), ensuring data persists even after restarting the system.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Instant Dashboard:** Immediately displays the top 3 upcoming tasks upon launch.
* **🧹 Auto-Cleanup Algorithm:** A silent startup check automatically deletes tasks strictly older than "today" to keep your list fresh.
* **💾 Persistence:** All data is stored in `task_data.json`, ensuring no data loss.
* **🔍 Smart Search:** Filter tasks by **Date** or **Description** keyword.
* **🛡️ Robust Validation:**
    * Prevents entering past dates.
    * Rejects empty descriptions.
    * Enforces `yyyy.mm.dd` format.
    * Handles corrupted files gracefully without crashing.

## 👤 User Stories

1.  **As a user**, I want to see a **dashboard of the next 3 tasks** immediately upon opening the app for a quick status update.
2.  **As a user**, I want to **add a new task** with a valid future date and description to keep my schedule accurate.
3.  **As a user**, I want to **search for a task** by date or description so I can efficiently plan my activities.
4.  **As a user**, I want to **edit specific tasks** to update their details as my plans change.
5.  **As a user**, I want to **delete completed or outdated tasks** to keep my workload focused.
6.  **As a user**, I want outdated tasks to be **automatically deleted** to keep my view clutter-free.
7.  **As a user**, I want the option to **cancel an action** (by typing '1') if I change my mind during input.
8.  **As a user**, I want my data **automatically saved** so I never lose my progress.

## ⚙️ Use Cases

### UC1: Launch & Auto-Cleanup
* **Trigger:** User runs `main.py`.
* **System Action:** Loads data, removes tasks older than `today`, sorts remaining tasks, and displays the **Main Menu** + **Top 3 Upcoming Tasks**.

### UC2: Add Task
* **Trigger:** User selects Option `2`.
* **Flow:** System prompts for date (`yyyy.mm.dd`) and description.
* **Validation:** Checks format and ensures date $\ge$ today. Confirms success upon saving.

### UC3: Search & View
* **Trigger:** User selects Option `1`.
* **Flow:** User chooses search mode (`0` for Description, `1` for Date) and enters query. System displays all matching results.

### UC4: Edit Task
* **Trigger:** User selects Option `3`.
* **Flow:** User searches for a task, selects it by ID, and provides new validated details. System overwrites the entry.

### UC5: Delete Task
* **Trigger:** User selects Option `4`.
* **Flow:** User finds a task, selects it, and confirms deletion. System permanently removes the entry.
