# TaskTracker

This project is intended to:

- Practice the complete process from **problem analysis to implementation**
- Apply basic **Python** programming concepts learned in the Programming Foundations module
- Demonstrate the use of **console interaction, data validation, and file processing**
- Produce clean, well-structured, and documented code
- Prepare students for **teamwork and documentation** in later modules
- Use this repository as a starting point by importing it into your own GitHub account.  
- Work only within your own copy — do not push to the original template.  
- Commit regularly to track your progress.


## 📝 Analysis

**Problem**
Users struggle to efficiently manage their daily tasks, such as homework, assignments and personal to-do's, because they don’t have a simple and reliable way to organize, edit, and save their tasks. Without the TaskTracker, users find it difficult to manage their workload and keep track of what needs to be done.

**Scenario**
TaskTracker helps users to track their tasks by letting them add, edit or delete them. Each entry includes a title, description, date, and time. The system ensures input validation (preventing empty or invalid entries, for example: for date and time users can only use numbers in the following format yyyy.mm.dd.). The program also includes data persistence, so users never lose their tasks, even after restarting the app. Once tasks are set, they will always be available and displayed to users whenever they open the application.

**User stories:**
1. As a user, I want to view all my stored tasks (including title, description, date, and time) sorted by date and time, so I can efficiently plan my activities and easily see what's today's tasks or on a specific day.
2. As a user, I want to add or modify tasks to keep my schedule accurate and up to date.
3. As a user, I want to easily select and delete specific tasks, so I can remove completed or outdated entries and keep my workload focused and up-to-date.
4. As a user, I want to add a new task with a title, description, date, and time, and be notified if I leave any required fields empty or use invalid input.
5. As a user, I want to be certain that all my tasks are automatically saved and immediately available and displayed when I restart the application, so I never lose my workload data.

## ✅ Project Requirements

Each app must meet the following three criteria in order to be accepted (see also the official project guidelines PDF on Moodle):

1. Interactive app (console input)
2. Data validation (input checking)
3. File processing (read/write)

---

### 1. Interactive App (Console Input)

> 🚧 In this section, it's described how this project fullfield the criterias.  
---
The application interacts with the user via the console. Users can:
- Select action "Show your task", "Add task", "Edit task", "Delete task", "Exit"
- Add a description and date of your task
- Chose an existing task to edit or delete
